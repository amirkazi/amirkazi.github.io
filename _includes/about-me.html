                <p class="text-faded">My interests are in data science and data engineering. I recently graduated
                  from the Harris School of Public Policy with a Master's in Public Policy - focused on data
                  analytics - and completed a fully-funded Data Science Fellowship at the Flatiron School.</p>
                <p class="text-faded">Previously, my work focused on Chinese language and culture. For six years I studied and worked in Beijing,
                  China. I first studied advanced Mandarin Chinese at Beijing Normal University, and later worked as a writer and editor at a television station.
                  In my last position, I managed several study abroad programs at the University of Chicago Center in Beijing.</p>
